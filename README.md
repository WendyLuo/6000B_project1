# 6000B_project1
In this project, you are required to train a model and then test on a test set.

traindata.csv, trainlabel.csv, testdata.csv

The training set includes a set of training data points stored in traindata.csv and the corresponding class labels stored in trainlabel.csv.

Each line in traindata.csv corresponds to a training point. There are in total 57 continuous features separated by commas.

Each line in trainlabel.csv contains the class label of the corresponding data point.

You need to train a model on the training set and additional pre- or post-processing on the training set is allowed.
You can use any classifer such as linear regression or SVM.

You need to predict class labels of the test data points stored in testdata.csv, which has the same format as traindata.csv.
The prediction of your model on the test dataset should be stored in a csv file where each line stores a predicted class label for one test data point.
